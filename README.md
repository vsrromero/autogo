# AutoGo API - Rent a car
This project is a REST API for a car rental company developed as a challenge for a job interview in PHP and Laravel. The initial challenge was to create the main endpoints (index, store, show, update, and destroy). However, I decided to continue developing the project to showcase my skills and use it as a portfolio.

Since this is a portfolio project, there are a few features that have not been implemented yet, such as an email messaging service, documentation for every route and method, and some other functionalities.

A sample documentation is provided within the project, but please note that it is not complete and has not been generated by a documentation generator. You can find it [here](./documentation/README.md).
